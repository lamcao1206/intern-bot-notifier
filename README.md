Open src/main/resources/application.properties and configure the URL of the webpage to monitor and any other preferences (such as the monitoring interval).
Example:
```
target.url=https://cse.internship.hcmut
tracker.interval=60
```

### 4. Run the application
You can run the application using the following Maven command:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
This will start the application and begin monitoring the webpage for changes.

## üì≤ How to Get Telegram Bot Credentials
To set up the Telegram bot and retrieve the required information, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Telegram Bot
1. Open Telegram: Download and open the Telegram app if you haven‚Äôt already.
2. Search for @BotFather:
- In the search bar, type BotFather and select the official bot.
- Create a New Bot:
- Start a chat with BotFather.
- Type /newbot and follow the prompts.
- BotFather will ask you to give your bot a name (e.g., InternBot).
- After that, it will ask for the bot‚Äôs username (this must end with bot, e.g., intern_bot).
### 2. Save the Token:
- Once the bot is created, BotFather will give you a token to access the Telegram Bot API.
- Copy the token, as you will need it for your ```telegram_credentials.json```.
### 3. Get the Chat ID
- To send notifications to your Telegram chat, you need the chat ID where the bot will send messages.
#### 1. Start a chat with your bot:
- Search for your bot by its username (e.g., intern_bot).
- Start a conversation with it (send any message to your bot).
#### 2. Get your chat ID:
- Open your browser and visit the following URL, replacing your-token-here with the token you obtained from BotFather:
```https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-token-here>/getUpdates```
- Look for the chat ID:
After sending a message to your bot, the response will include a JSON object with information about the messages, including the chat ID.
For example, the response might look like this:
```
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "update_id": 123456789,
      "message": {
        "message_id": 1,
        "from": {
          "id": 1234567890,
          "is_bot": false,
          "first_name": "Your Name",
          "username": "yourusername",
          "language_code": "en"
        },
        "chat": {
          "id": -1234567890123,
          "first_name": "Your Name",
          "last_name": "Last Name",
          "username": "yourusername",
          "type": "private"
        },
        "date": 1609459200,
        "text": "Hello"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
The chat.id field (-1234567890123 in this example) is your chat ID.
